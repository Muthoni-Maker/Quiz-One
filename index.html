           I am a girl who first fell in love with programming the very first time I touched a 
           computer.And from then onwards I knew this is what I was made for.Nothing brings me joy like
           using the skills I have to come up with products that solve a certain problem.Because in as 
           much as I do this out of passion,solving problems is the brain of it all.My main area of interest 
           lays in python language.I also do enjoy writing JavaScript code.<br>
           When I am not coding,I enjoy reading science fiction novels,listening to music and 
           playing board games.I believe life is all about living in the moment and doing what brings you 
           joy.That is why I always focus on doing what I am passionate about and what brings me joy.
